Hello friends. After the past semester it has been a pleasure teaching you all. I hope you've enjoyed the wargames and materials as much as I have had building them. I've definitely enjoyed running all the tutorials and writing these challenges and hopefully you enjoy breaking webapps as much as I do after a semester of my sadistic tendencies. You have all been a wonderful cohort to teach and its been a very enjoyable semester. 

The following exam should be challenging but also fun. All the challenges have working solver scripts, so don't tell me its unsolvable. If you're not sure on what to do, you already know what meme i'm going to post. I'll be online most of the time to help, but enjoy the exam. 

If you would like to contribute to how the course is run in later years, please don't hesitate to fill in this [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSctBhjom877Xd1VUAGm7bseXnXpk3hjMD26mjUjXnZsHm5kYw/viewform?usp=sf_link). Its different to the one for cs6443, so don't worry.
